This is a simulation of the excellent Android/PC game Gladiabots.  It's the only game I play on my phone :-)  

I created this for the purpose of helping me test retreatment scenarios and help me built better AIs within the game and also it's given me a chance to play with React + Mobx.

"Gladiabots is a tactical game in which you create the AI of your robots.
